# SGMwSMC++

This is an R/C++ implementation of [Sequential decision model for inference and prediction on nonuniform hypergraphs with application to knot matching from computational forestry](https://doi.org/10.1214/19-AOAS1255).
Its name derives from the original [SGMwSMC](https://github.com/junseonghwan/sgmwsmc) codebase, which this is a partial port of.
